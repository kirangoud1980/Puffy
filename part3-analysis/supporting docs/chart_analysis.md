1. Events Over Time — Engagement is Stable
==========================================
This chart shows that daily traffic volume is steady, meaning user interest and site health are stable even during the DQ incident window.

Why it matters:

No drop in user activity → demand and engagement are healthy.

Confirms issues were data-quality related, not real business decline.


2. Revenue Over Time — Real Revenue Remains Strong, Despite DQ Corruption
=========================================================================
Despite corrupted checkout payloads and zero-revenue orders, the trend shows strong revenue days, with peaks on Feb 28 and Mar 1.

Insight:
Actual business remains healthy — the dips match missing referrer/client_id issues, not real sales declines.


3. Device Performance — Mobile Dominates
========================================
Unique active users by device:

Interpretation:

Mobile users > Desktop users → mobile-first engagement.

Many product views and ATC actions originate from mobile.

Desktop still contributes more to successful checkouts (behavioral pattern seen in ecommerce).


4. Funnel Analysis — User Intent is Strong
==========================================
Funnel event counts:

Even with missing event_data on some commerce events, trends show:

Very strong top-of-funnel (page_views)

Healthy add-to-cart volumes

Lower checkout_started due to corrupted payloads

Checkout_completed counts present but understated

Takeaway:
The true funnel is stronger than what the corrupted data suggests.
