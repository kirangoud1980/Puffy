Below is Business Performance Assessment (Built on transformed data)

1) What’s Working
===================
A. Marketing channels are generating meaningful revenue (even with gaps).

From first-click and last-click attribution:

Certain channels consistently appear as top revenue drivers (the data suggests Google Search / Organic and Direct-returning users show repeated touch patterns).
Returning visitors contribute disproportionately to completed checkouts, indicating strong brand familiarity.

Even though DQ issues distorted some days, the underlying pattern shows healthy demand and meaningful marketing influence.

B. Engagement levels remain steady across the 14-day period.

Based on event counts & funnels:

Daily event volume is stable (no traffic crash), indicating no disruption in user activity.
Users continue to browse, add items, and initiate checkout at normal rates.
Funnel engagement (PV → ATC → Checkout Start) appears steady, confirming that user intent remains strong.

This means the business fundamentals (traffic + user intent) are intact.

C. Mobile usage is strong and rising.

From device analysis:

Mobile > Desktop in unique active users.
Mobile users generate a large share of top-of-funnel activity (page views, product exploration).

This implies marketing spend on mobile discovery channels is effective.

D. Attribution windows still capture meaningful multi-day behavior.

The model picked up:

Many buyers had multiple touchpoints over several days.
The 7-day window captured a realistic spread of interactions, showing buyers are not purely impulse-driven.

That suggests high research-driven buyer behavior, typical of considered purchases — good for brand stability.

2) What's Concerning
=====================
A. Revenue reporting is inconsistent due to multiple issues.

Zero-revenue checkouts artificially depress revenue totals.
Missing/invalid items arrays break product-level insights.
Some transactions have no buyer identity or channel association.

This means dashboards may show lower revenue trends than reality.

B. Marketing attribution is heavily distorted.

Because of missing referrer and identity loss:

Large % of purchases are attributed to Direct/Unknown.
True paid channel contribution is systematically under-counted.
Campaign ROI may appear worse than it actually is.

This creates a false signal that marketing isn’t working — when it may be performing well.

C. Significant identity loss (missing client_id) breaks behavioral patterns.

This causes:
Session drops (lower sessions-per-user)
Reduced funnel visibility
Broken user journey paths
Inability to link earlier marketing touches to purchases

This is operationally concerning because it hides real behavioral trends.

D. Conversion funnel appears artificially weak due to corrupt events.

Missing event_data for key commerce steps makes it look like:
Fewer add-to-carts are happening
Fewer checkouts are initiated

But this is not user behavior — it’s data failure.

E. Some files contain synthetic/fake referrers.

This injects noise into channel performance and decreases confidence in attribution.


3) Key Patterns in User Behavior (Based on actual data trends)
===============================================================

A. Users show multi-step buying behavior

Many buyers viewed products across multiple sessions, indicating:
Research-driven purchasing
Strong consideration stage
Value in remarketing & retargeting

B. High top-of-funnel engagement

Page views and browsing events remain strong across all days, even during data issues.

This indicates user demand is stable.

C. Return visitors contribute strongly to conversions

Users converting often had earlier touches, suggesting:
Brand familiarity is high
Paid channels effectively drive first-time visits
Direct/return visits close the sale

D. Device pattern: Mobile dominates discovery, Desktop contributes to conversion

A common industry pattern observed here:
Users browse on Mobile
Users complete checkout mostly on Desktop (in the days with good data)

Even with corrupted days, this pattern is visible.


4) Key Patterns in Marketing Performance
===========================================

A. Channels are doing their job at top-of-funnel

Early-step events (landing pages, browsing) correlate with marketing touchpoints such as:
Organic Search
Paid Search
Referral sites

Marketing is successfully driving awareness & consideration.

B. Attribution shows assist value across multiple touches

The 7-day lookback reveals:
Many purchases have more than one touch
Early touch (first-click) is not the same as the final conversion channel (last-click)

This indicates:
Display/Paid social play a discovery role
Direct/Organic play a conversion role

C. Null referrers distort but do not eliminate channel patterns

Even where referrer was present:
Consistent channel structures reappear
Repeatable clusters of channel usage exist (Organic → Direct, Paid → Direct, Referral → Direct)

This means the underlying marketing mix is working.


Overall - Despite significant data quality failures in March, the actual user behavior and marketing performance remain healthy:

Traffic is stable
Engagement is strong
Mobile remains critical
Multi-touch funnel is functioning
Marketing channels influence early-stage engagement
Conversions are driven by return visits, highlighting brand strength

BUT — core analytics and attribution are currently unreliable due to missing referrers, missing client IDs, and malformed order payloads.

Once these regressions are resolved and backfilled, the business will have accurate visibility again, and performance is likely better than what current dashboards show.
